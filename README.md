The project explores how weather conditions, holidays, and events affect bus ridership patterns, applying machine learning models such as Linear Regression, ARIMA, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Key findings highlight the importance of weekday/weekend patterns, temperature, and festival periods. Random Forest performed best.
